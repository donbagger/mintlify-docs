## Why You Need Historical Price Data

Building a crypto app? You'll likely need price charts, volatility analysis, or backtesting data. That's where OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data comes in - it's the backbone of any serious crypto application.

**Common use cases:**
- **Price charts** in trading apps
- **Backtesting** trading strategies  
- **Volatility analysis** for risk management
- **Historical performance** dashboards
- **Market research** and analytics

<Tip>
  **Quick Start**: If you know your token already, jump to [Step 2](#step-2-get-price-history-data) to grab the data immediately.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Find Your Token's Trading Pool

Here's the thing - historical data comes from actual trading pools, not tokens directly. This makes sense because prices happen where people trade.

### Quick Search (Recommended)
The fastest way to find what you need using the [Search API](/api-reference/search/search-for-tokens-pools-and-dexes):

```bash
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/search?query=USDC" | jq
```

**Pro tip**: Search returns tokens, pools, and exchanges. Look for pools with high volume - they'll have the most reliable price data.

### If You Have the Token Address
Skip the search and go straight to pools using the [Token Pools API](/api-reference/tokens/get-top-x-pools-for-a-token):

```bash
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/tokens/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48/pools" | jq
```

<Note>
Always pick pools with decent volume (>$10k daily). Low-volume pools can have weird price spikes that don't reflect real market conditions.
</Note>

## Step 2: Get Price History Data

Now for the good stuff. Here's how to pull historical OHLCV data using the [Pool OHLCV API](/api-reference/pools/get-ohlcv-data-for-a-pool-pair):

```bash
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools/0x88e6a0c2ddd26feeb64f039a2c41296fcb3f5640/ohlcv?start=2025-01-01&limit=30&interval=24h&inversed=true" | jq
```

*(Using USDC/ETH pool on Ethereum as example in this tutorial)*

### What These Parameters Do:

| Parameter | What It Does | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| `start` | When to start collecting data | `2025-01-01` or Unix timestamp |
| `limit` | How many data points (max 366) | `30` for 30 days |
| `interval` | Time between each point | `24h`, `1h`, `5m`, etc. |
| `end` | When to stop (optional) | `2025-01-31` |
| `inversed` | Flip the price ratio | `true` for ETH/USDC â†’ USDC/ETH |

### What You Get Back:

```json
[
  {
    "time_open": "2025-01-30T00:00:00Z",
    "time_close": "2025-01-31T00:00:00Z",
    "open": 3115.1614508315265,
    "high": 3277.717757396331,
    "low": 3097.803416632386,
    "close": 3250.184016286268,
    "volume": 226403988
  }
]
```

Each data point gives you everything you need for candlestick charts or analysis.

## Time Intervals That Actually Matter

Choose based on what you're building:

**For Trading Apps:**
- `1m`, `5m` - Real-time trading
- `1h`, `4h` - Swing trading
- `24h` - Position trading

**For Analytics Dashboards:**
- `24h` - Daily summaries
- Use daily data and aggregate for weekly/monthly views

**For Research:**
- `24h` with longer date ranges (up to 1 year)

## Production Tips That'll Save You Time

### Cache Aggressively
Historical data doesn't change - cache it locally:

```bash
# Check when pool was created to avoid requesting non-existent data
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools/0x88e6a0c2ddd26feeb64f039a2c41296fcb3f5640" | jq '.created_at'
```

### Handle Data Gaps
Some pools have quiet periods. Here's how to deal with gaps:

```bash
# Filter out low-volume periods that might have unreliable prices
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools/0x88e6a0c2ddd26feeb64f039a2c41296fcb3f5640/ohlcv?start=2025-01-01&limit=30&inversed=true" | jq '.[] | select(.volume > 1000)'
```

### Multi-Pool Strategy
For major tokens, cross-reference data from multiple pools:

```bash
# Get all USDC pools to compare price consistency
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/tokens/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48/pools?limit=5" | jq '.pools[] | .id'
```

### Rate Limiting
Don't hammer the API. We suggest you to batch your requests and cache results:

```javascript
// Example: Batch multiple token histories
const tokens = ['USDC', 'WETH', 'USDT'];
const historyPromises = tokens.map(token => 
  fetch(`/api/history/${token}`).then(r => r.json())
);
const allHistories = await Promise.all(historyPromises);
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Empty Response" 
Pool might not have data for your date range:
```bash
# Check pool age first
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools/0x88e6a0c2ddd26feeb64f039a2c41296fcb3f5640" | jq '.created_at'
```

### "Weird Price Spikes"
You hit a low-liquidity period. Switch to shorter intervals or higher-volume pools:
```bash
# Use 6h intervals to smooth out anomalies
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools/0x88e6a0c2ddd26feeb64f039a2c41296fcb3f5640/ohlcv?start=2025-01-01&interval=6h&limit=50&inversed=true"
```

### "Upside-Down Prices"
You need the inverted ratio:
```bash
# Flip from TOKEN/ETH to ETH/TOKEN
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools/0x88e6a0c2ddd26feeb64f039a2c41296fcb3f5640/ohlcv?start=2025-01-01&inversed=true&limit=10"
```
