## Why Monitor New Pools?

New liquidity pools are where the action happens in DeFi. They signal new token launches, liquidity migrations, and fresh trading opportunities. Being first to spot them can be a serious advantage.

**What you can catch early:**
- **New token launches** before they hit major trackers
- **Arbitrage opportunities** between pools
- **Liquidity migrations** to better DEXes
- **Emerging projects** before they explode

<Tip>
  **TL;DR**: Jump to [Step 2](#step-2-get-newest-pools) if you want to start pulling new pools immediately.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Pick Your Networks

First, see what blockchains you want to monitor using the [Networks API](/api-reference/networks/get-a-list-of-available-blockchain-networks):

```bash
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks" | jq '.[] | {id: .id, name: .display_name}'
```

---

## Step 2: Get Newest Pools

Here's the money shot - getting pools sorted by creation date using the [Network Pools API](/api-reference/pools/get-top-x-pools-on-a-network):

```bash
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=10" | jq
```

### What These Parameters Do:

| Parameter | Effect | Pro Tip |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `orderBy=created_at` | Sort by when pool was made | Only way to find truly new pools |
| `sort=desc` | Newest first | Use `asc` for historical analysis |
| `limit=10` | How many pools back | Max is 100, but 10-20 is usually enough |
| `page=0` | Pagination | Increase for deeper history |

### What You Get:

```json
{
  "pools": [
    {
      "id": "0x462229e7fc9e6cab0ebbd643cc6dfef2a5261ee9",
      "dex_name": "Uniswap V2",
      "created_at": "2025-06-09T09:28:35Z",
      "volume_usd": 767.17,
      "transactions": 5,
      "tokens": [
        {
          "symbol": "🧸TEDDYS",
          "name": "🧸TeddySwap",
          "fdv": 18769.56
        },
        {
          "symbol": "WETH", 
          "fdv": 6617036250.33
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Crazy high FDV on new tokens (possible honeypot)
- Zero transactions after hours (might be a test pool)

## Focus on Specific DEXes

Want to monitor just Uniswap or Raydium? First get the DEX list using the [Network DEXes API](/api-reference/dexes/get-a-list-of-available-dexes-on-a-network):

```bash
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/dexes" | jq '.[] | {id: .id, name: .name}'
```

Then filter new pools by DEX using the [DEX Pools API](/api-reference/pools/get-top-x-pools-on-a-networks-dex):

```bash
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/dexes/uniswap_v3/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=10" | jq
```

---

## Multi-Chain Monitoring

Real pros monitor multiple chains simultaneously. Here's how:

### Ethereum
```bash
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=5" | jq '.pools[] | {chain: "ethereum", pool: .id, created: .created_at, volume: .volume_usd, tokens: [.tokens[].symbol]}'
```

### Solana 
```bash
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/solana/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=5" | jq '.pools[] | {chain: "solana", pool: .id, created: .created_at, volume: .volume_usd, tokens: [.tokens[].symbol]}'
```

### Base
```bash
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/base/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=5" | jq '.pools[] | {chain: "base", pool: .id, created: .created_at, volume: .volume_usd, tokens: [.tokens[].symbol]}'
```

**Pro tip**: Use different limits based on chain activity. Solana might need `limit=20` because of memecoin amounts, while Ethereum `limit=5` catches the important stuff.

## Smart Filtering Strategies

### Only High-Activity Pools
Skip the dead pools - focus on ones with real trading:

```bash
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=50" | jq '.pools[] | select(.volume_usd > 1000 and .transactions > 10) | {id: .id, created: .created_at, volume: .volume_usd, txns: .transactions}'
```

### Last 24 Hours Only
Filter by timestamp to get super fresh pools:

```bash
# Get pools from last 24 hours (adjust date as needed)
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=100" | jq --arg yesterday "$(date -d '1 day ago' -Iseconds)" '.pools[] | select(.created_at > $yesterday) | {id: .id, age: .created_at, volume: .volume_usd}'
```

### New Token Launches
Look for pools where the tokens themselves are brand new:

```bash
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=20" | jq '.pools[] | select(.tokens[] | .added_at > "2025-01-25T00:00:00Z") | {pool: .id, pool_age: .created_at, new_tokens: [.tokens[] | select(.added_at > "2025-01-25T00:00:00Z") | .symbol]}'
```

## Production Monitoring Setup

### Simple Monitoring Script
Here's a bash script that checks for new pools every 5 minutes:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Monitor new pools across multiple chains
CHAINS=("ethereum" "solana" "base")
MIN_VOLUME=5000

while true; do
    echo "🔍 Checking for new pools at $(date)"
    
    for chain in "${CHAINS[@]}"; do
        echo "--- $chain ---"
        
        # Get new pools with decent volume
        curl -s "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/$chain/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=10" | \
        jq --argjson min_vol $MIN_VOLUME '.pools[] | select(.volume_usd > $min_vol) | {
            pool_id: .id,
            chain: "'$chain'",
            created: .created_at,
            volume: .volume_usd,
            tokens: [.tokens[].symbol]
        }'
    done
    
    echo "⏰ Sleeping for 5 minutes..."
    sleep 300
done
```

### Alert on High-Volume New Pools
Catch the big moves automatically:

```bash
# Check for new pools with serious volume
NEW_POOLS=$(curl -s "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=20" | jq '.pools[] | select(.volume_usd > 50000)')

if [ -n "$NEW_POOLS" ]; then
    echo "🚨 HIGH VOLUME NEW POOL DETECTED!"
    echo "$NEW_POOLS"
    # Add your notification here (Discord webhook, Slack, email, etc.)
    # curl -X POST "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK" -d "{\"content\": \"New high-volume pool: $NEW_POOLS\"}"
fi
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "No New Pools Found"
Check if you're looking at the right timeframe:
```bash
# See when the last pool was created
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=1" | jq '.pools[0].created_at'
```

### "Too Much Spam"
Filter out low-quality pools:
```bash
# More restrictive filtering
curl "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/solana/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=50" | jq '.pools[] | select(.transactions > 20 and .volume_usd > 5000 and (.tokens[0].fdv < 100000000 or .tokens[1].fdv < 100000000))'
```

### "Missing Opportunities"
You might need to check more frequently or cast a wider net:
```bash
# Check multiple DEXes on one chain
for dex in uniswap_v3 uniswap_v2 sushiswap; do
    echo "=== $dex ==="
    curl -s "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/dexes/$dex/pools?orderBy=created_at&sort=desc&limit=3" | jq '.pools[0] | {dex: "'$dex'", created: .created_at, tokens: [.tokens[].symbol]}'
done
```
