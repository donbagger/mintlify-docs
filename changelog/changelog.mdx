This page contains all significant updates, improvements, and bug fixes for the DexPaprika API. We're committed to making our product better with each release. Check our [API reference](/api-reference) for the latest version.

<Update label="2025-06-17" description="v1.3.1" tags={["API", "Schema", "Docs"]}>
  ## Enhanced
  * **Transaction Schema:**
    * Added `token_0_symbol` and `token_1_symbol` fields to transaction objects for explicit token symbol tracking.
    * Added `price_0`, `price_1`, `price_0_usd`, and `price_1_usd` fields to transaction objects for detailed price reporting.
    * Added `created_at` field to transaction objects for precise transaction timestamping.

  ## Migration/Compatibility
  * No breaking changes to existing endpoints, but clients parsing transaction objects should update their models to support the new fields for full compatibility.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-01-27" description="v1.3.0" tags={["API", "Breaking Changes", "Deprecation"]}>
  ## Deprecated
  * **BREAKING**: The [`/pools`](/api-reference/pools/get-top-x-pools) endpoint has been permanently deprecated and now returns `410 Gone`
  * Users should migrate to [`/networks/{network}/pools`](/api-reference/pools/get-top-x-pools-on-a-network) to get top pools for each specific network

  ## Changed
  * Enhanced deprecation messaging with clear migration paths for affected endpoints

  ## Migration Guide
  Instead of using the deprecated global pools endpoint:
  ```
  GET /pools
  ```
  
  Use the network-specific pools endpoint for each blockchain:
  ```
  GET /networks/ethereum/pools
  GET /networks/solana/pools
  GET /networks/fantom/pools
  ```
  
  This change provides better performance and more relevant results by focusing on network-specific data.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-05-12" description="v1.2.1" tags={["API", "Feature", "Docs"]}>
  ## Added
  * Introduced the optional `reorder` query parameter to the [`/networks/{network}/tokens/{token_address}/pools`](/api-reference/tokens/get-top-x-pools-for-a-token) endpoint. This allows clients to reorder pool data so the specified token becomes the primary token for all metrics and calculations.
</Update>

<Update label="2025-04-10" description="v1.2.0" tags={["API", "Breaking Changes"]}>
  ## Added
  * Added operation IDs to all endpoints for better client code generation
  * Added fully diluted valuation (`fdv`) field to token responses
  * Added detailed license information and contact details in API specification
  * Added `buy_usd` and `sell_usd` fields to provide monetary values for trades
  * Added `last_price_usd_change` field to all time intervals (24h, 6h, 1h, 30m, 15m, 5m, 1m)
  * Added organized API tags with descriptions for better navigation

  ## Changed
  * Updated OpenAPI specification from 3.0.3 to 3.1.0 for improved documentation
  * Changed [OHLCV endpoint](/api-reference/pools/get-ohlcv-data-for-a-pool-pair) response format from wrapped object to direct array of records (Breaking Change)
  * Renamed `buy`/`sell` fields to `buys`/`sells` for consistency (Breaking Change)
  * Changed [network](/api-reference/networks) response format from object to array for cleaner consumption
  * Updated network schema with improved field naming (`display_name` instead of just `name`)
  * Standardized ID field in Network schema to use string identifiers instead of numeric IDs
  * Enhanced token schema with additional fields: chain, total_supply, added_at, last_updated
  * Improved parameter documentation with examples and clearer descriptions

  ## Fixed
  * Improved consistency in representing null values in responses
  * Updated example responses to more accurately reflect actual API behavior
  * Fixed formatting inconsistencies in API documentation

  ## Improved
  * Enhanced OHLCV schema with time_open and time_close fields to clearly define candlestick periods
  * Improved validation for time intervals and limits in OHLCV endpoint
  * Added explicit error response documentation for the /stats endpoint
