## What is Cursor IDE?

Cursor is a powerful AI-first code editor built on top of VS Code that provides advanced AI assistance for developers. With its built-in Claude integration and MCP (Model Context Protocol) support, Cursor can access external data sources and documentation to provide more intelligent coding assistance.

## Why integrate DexPaprika with Cursor?

Integrating DexPaprika documentation and data with Cursor IDE provides several powerful benefits:

- **Real-time crypto data access** - Get live market data, pool information, and token prices while coding
- **Enhanced AI assistance** - Cursor's AI can reference DexPaprika documentation and data for better code suggestions
- **DeFi development workflow** - Build DeFi applications with direct access to comprehensive blockchain data
- **Documentation context** - AI can reference our API docs, tutorials, and examples while helping you code

</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify MCP Integration">
1. Open a new chat with Claude in Cursor (Cmd/Ctrl + L)
2. Ask a question like: "What are the top liquidity pools on Ethereum?"
3. You should see DexPaprika data being retrieved and displayed
4. Try asking about specific networks, tokens, or pools to test the integration

</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Can't find the button?** The "Connect to Cursor" button appears on pages where MCP integration is relevant. If you don't see it, you can also manually configure the MCP server using the method below.
</Note>

## Step 2: Add documentation context

Once you have the MCP server installed, enhance your development experience by adding our documentation to your Cursor workspace for full API reference indexing.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Cursor settings">
1. In Cursor, go to **Settings** (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Navigate to **Indexing & Docs** in the left sidebar
3. This section allows you to add custom documentation for AI context

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tutorials/cursor-ide-integration/4.png" alt="Screenshot of Cursor IDE settings panel showing the Indexing & Docs section with the Docs area highlighted" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Add DexPaprika documentation">
1. In the **Docs** section, click **"+ Add Doc"**
2. Fill out the documentation details:
   - **Name**: "DexPaprika API Reference"
   - **URL**: `https://docs.dexpaprika.com/api-reference/introduction`
3. Click **"Add"** to complete the setup
4. This will index our full API reference for AI context

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tutorials/cursor-ide-integration/5.png" alt="Screenshot of Cursor IDE showing the Add Doc dialog with DexPaprika API Reference name and URL filled out" />
</Frame>
</Step>


</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Using the URL `https://docs.dexpaprika.com/api-reference/introduction` ensures Cursor indexes our complete API reference, giving you access to all endpoints, parameters, and examples in your AI conversations.
</Tip>

## Manual MCP server configuration

If you can't find the "Connect to Cursor" button or prefer manual setup, you can configure the MCP server manually by following our [hosted MCP server guide](/ai-integration/hosted-mcp-server).

<Note>
  **Need help with manual setup?** Our hosted MCP server guide provides detailed instructions for configuring the DexPaprika MCP server in Cursor, Claude Desktop, and other MCP-compatible tools.

## Usage examples

### Example 1: Building a DeFi dashboard

Ask Cursor to help you build a DeFi dashboard with real-time data:

```
"Help me create a React component that displays the top 5 liquidity pools 
on Ethereum using the DexPaprika API. Include volume, TVL, and price data."
```

Cursor can now:
- Reference our API documentation for correct endpoint usage
- Provide real-time pool data for testing
- Suggest optimal data fetching patterns
- Help with error handling and loading states

2. Enable "Use workspace files as context" in AI settings
3. Try asking more specific questions about our API
4. Restart Cursor to refresh context
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Slow response times">
**Symptoms**: Cursor takes a long time to respond with DexPaprika data.

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection speed
2. Try breaking complex queries into smaller parts
3. Use specific network/token names in your queries
4. Consider using the hosted MCP server for better performance
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication issues">
**Symptoms**: Getting authentication or permission errors.

**Solutions**:
1. DexPaprika API is publicly accessible - no authentication required

## Best practices

### For optimal performance

1. **Use specific queries** - Instead of "show me all pools", ask for "top 5 USDC/ETH pools on Ethereum"
2. **Cache frequently used data** - Store common queries locally to reduce API calls
3. **Handle errors gracefully** - Implement proper error handling for network issues
4. **Monitor rate limits** - Be mindful of API usage patterns

### For better AI assistance

1. **Provide context** - Tell Cursor what you're building and your goals
2. **Reference documentation** - Ask Cursor to explain concepts from our docs
3. **Iterate on solutions** - Ask follow-up questions to refine the code
4. **Test with real data** - Use actual DexPaprika data in your development
