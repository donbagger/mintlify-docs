## Quick integration guide

### Claude desktop setup

Add our hosted MCP server to Claude Desktop in just 2 steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate your configuration file">
Find your Claude Desktop configuration file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
</Step>

    "dexpaprika": {
      "url": "https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

If the file already exists, add our server to the existing `mcpServers` object:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dexpaprika": {
      "url": "https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

Save the file and restart Claude Desktop. You're ready to go!

1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Go to **Settings** (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
3. Navigate to **Tools & Integrations**
4. Click **New MCP server**
</Step>

<Step title="Configure in mcp.json">
This will open the `mcp.json` file. Add the DexPaprika server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dexpaprika": {
      "url": "https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/sse"

## Connection options

Our hosted MCP server supports multiple transport protocols to ensure compatibility with different clients and use cases:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Server-sent events (SSE) - Recommended">
**Endpoint:** `https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/sse`

**Best for:** Claude Desktop, Cursor, and most MCP clients  
**Benefits:** Real-time streaming updates, excellent browser compatibility, automatic reconnection  
**Use cases:** Live price monitoring, real-time pool updates, continuous market data feeds

This is the recommended option for most users as it provides the smoothest experience with popular AI tools.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Streamable HTTP">
**Endpoint:** `https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/streamable-http`

**Best for:** Custom applications, web services, and clients that prefer HTTP streaming  
**Benefits:** Standard HTTP protocol, works well with firewalls, easier debugging  
**Use cases:** Integration with existing web infrastructure, corporate environments with strict network policies

Perfect for developers building custom integrations or working in environments where SSE might be restricted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="JSON-RPC over HTTP">
**Endpoint:** `https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/json-rpc`

**Best for:** Traditional API integrations, batch processing, simple request-response patterns  
**Benefits:** Familiar REST-like interface, stateless communication, easy to cache  
**Use cases:** Periodic data fetching, batch analysis, integration with existing JSON-RPC systems

Ideal for applications that don't need real-time updates and prefer traditional API communication patterns.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Getting started?** Use the SSE endpoint (`https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/sse`) for the best experience with Claude Desktop and Cursor. You can always switch protocols later based on your specific needs.
