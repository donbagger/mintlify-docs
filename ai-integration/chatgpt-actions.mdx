## What are ChatGPT Actions?

ChatGPT Actions allow you to connect ChatGPT to external APIs, enabling it to retrieve real-time data and perform actions beyond its training data. With DexPaprika's ChatGPT Actions integration, you can access live cryptocurrency and DeFi data directly within your ChatGPT conversations.

<Note>
  **Ready-to-use OpenAPI URL:** Visit [mcp.dexpaprika.com/openapi](https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/openapi) to get the pre-configured OpenAPI specification URL for immediate use with ChatGPT Actions.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- **ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise subscription** - Actions are only available for paid ChatGPT users
- Access to **ChatGPT's custom GPT creation** interface
- Basic understanding of API integrations (helpful but not required)

## Step-by-Step setup guide

### Step 1: Create a new Custom GPT

1. **Log in to ChatGPT** and navigate to your dashboard
2. **Click "Explore"** in the sidebar
3. **Select "Create a GPT"** from the top of the page
4. **Choose "Configure"** tab for manual setup

### Step 2: Configure your GPT

Fill in the basic information for your custom GPT:

- **Name**: `DexPaprika Crypto Assistant`
- **Description**: `Get real-time cryptocurrency and DeFi data across 20+ blockchain networks`
- **Instructions**: 
```
You are a cryptocurrency and DeFi data assistant powered by DexPaprika. You can access real-time data about:
- Blockchain networks and their supported DEXes
- Liquidity pools and their metrics (TVL, volume, fees)
- Token prices and market data
- DEX trading activity and analytics
- Cross-chain comparisons and analysis

Always provide accurate, up-to-date information and explain complex DeFi concepts clearly. When showing pool data, include relevant metrics like TVL, 24h volume, and fee tiers when available.
```

### Step 3: Add the DexPaprika Action

1. **Scroll down to the "Actions" section**
2. **Click "Create new action"**
3. **Get the OpenAPI URL** from [mcp.dexpaprika.com/openapi](https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/openapi)
4. **Import the schema**:
   - Select **"Import from URL"**
   - Paste the OpenAPI URL: `https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/openapi`
   - Click **"Import"**

<Tip>
  The OpenAPI specification will automatically configure all available DexPaprika endpoints, including networks, pools, tokens, and search functionality.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Configure action settings

1. **Authentication**: Select "None" (DexPaprika API is publicly accessible)
2. **Privacy policy**: Add `https://dexpaprika.com/terms/` if required
3. **Action description**: The description will be auto-filled from the OpenAPI spec

### Step 5: Test and Publish

1. **Click "Test"** to verify the integration works
2. **Try a sample query**: "What are the top 5 liquidity pools on Ethereum?"
3. **Click "Save"** when everything works correctly
4. **Choose visibility**: Keep private or share with others

## Usage examples

Once your ChatGPT Action is set up, you can ask questions like:

### Network and DEX queries
- "Which blockchain networks does DexPaprika support?"
- "What are the top DEXes on Solana by trading volume?"
- "Show me all available DEXes on Arbitrum"

### Pool analysis
- "What are the most liquid USDC/ETH pools across all networks?"
- "Find the highest volume pools on Uniswap V3"
- "Compare fees between different USDT/USDC pools"

### Token information
- "What's the current price of SOL across different DEXes?"
- "Show me all pools containing PEPE token"
- "Get detailed information about Chainlink token on Ethereum"

### Market research
- "Find newly created pools with high trading volume"
- "What's the total trading volume on PancakeSwap today?"
- "Compare liquidity between Ethereum and Polygon networks"

### Advanced analytics
- "Analyze arbitrage opportunities between Uniswap and SushiSwap"

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Action not working or returning errors">
**Solutions**:
1. Verify the OpenAPI URL is correctly imported: `https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/openapi`
2. Check that your ChatGPT subscription includes Actions (Plus or Enterprise)
3. Try recreating the Action if import failed
4. Ensure no typos in the OpenAPI URL
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Limited or missing data">
**Solutions**:
1. Be more specific in your queries (include network names, token symbols)
2. Try different phrasings for your questions
3. Check if the requested data exists (some networks/tokens may have limited pools)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Slow response times">
**Solutions**:
1. Break complex queries into smaller, focused questions
2. Ask for specific data rather than broad overviews
3. Be patient - real-time data fetching may take a few seconds
</Accordion>
