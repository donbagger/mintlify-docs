## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an [open protocol standard customized by Claude](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for establishing unified context interaction between AI models and development environments, enabling AI to better understand and process code. The DexPaprika MCP server leverages this protocol to provide AI assistants like Claude with access to real-time crypto and DeFi market data, enabling advanced conversations about blockchain networks, decentralized exchanges (DEXes), liquidity pools, and tokens across the DeFi ecosystem.

### Prerequisites

Before installing the DexPaprika MCP server, ensure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher) installed on your system
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop) or [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) installed if you want to use the MCP server with these applications

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Global Installation (Recommended)

Installing the DexPaprika MCP server globally makes it available throughout your system:

```bash
npm install -g dexpaprika-mcp
```

After installation, you can start the server by running:

```bash
dexpaprika-mcp
```

#### Option 2: Use with npx (No Installation)

Alternatively, you can run the server directly without installation using npx:

```bash
npx dexpaprika-mcp
```

This is useful for trying out the server without permanently installing it.

### Verification

To verify that your installation was successful, run:

```bash
dexpaprika-mcp --version
```

You should see the current version number of the DexPaprika MCP server.

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop Configuration

To use the DexPaprika MCP server with Claude Desktop:

1. Download and install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop) if you haven't already
2. Locate your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

3. If the file doesn't exist, create it with the following content:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dexpaprika": {
      "command": "dexpaprika-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

4. If the file already exists, add the DexPaprika configuration to the existing `mcpServers` object:
```json
"dexpaprika": {
  "command": "dexpaprika-mcp"
}
```

5. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop.

6. To verify the configuration, open Claude Desktop and try asking a question about cryptocurrency data, such as "What are the top liquidity pools on Ethereum?"

<Note>Make sure you have the latest version of our package by running `npm update -g dexpaprika-mcp`</Note>

### Cursor Configuration

If you're using Cursor IDE with Claude:

1. Download and install [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) if you haven't already
2. Open Cursor and click on the Claude button in the sidebar
3. Click on the settings icon (⚙️) and select "Add MCP Server"
4. Fill in the following information:
   - **Server name**: `dexpaprika`
   - **Type**: `command` (select from dropdown)
   - **Command to run**: `npx dexpaprika-mcp`
5. Click "Add" to save the configuration
6. Alternatively, Cursor will automatically use any MCP servers configured in Claude Desktop

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the DexPaprika MCP server:
