## What is VS Code?

Visual Studio Code is a popular open-source editor with rich AI and extension capabilities. With MCP (Model Context Protocol) support in Copilot Chat, VS Code can access external data sources and documentation to provide more intelligent coding assistance.

## Why integrate DexPaprika with VS Code?

- **Real-time crypto data access** - Live market data, pool information, and token prices while coding
- **Enhanced AI assistance** - Copilot Chat can reference DexPaprika data for better suggestions
- **DeFi development workflow** - Build faster with comprehensive blockchain data
- **Documentation context** - Quickly reference our API docs and tutorials while you work

## Step 1: Install MCP server with one click

Use the "Connect to VS Code" button in our docs to open VS Code and add the DexPaprika MCP server.

<Steps>
<Step title="Find the Connect Button">
1. Look for the **"Connect to VS Code"** button in our documentation
2. Click the button to open VS Code and start MCP installation

</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm the Server URL">
1. The install dialog pre-fills the DexPaprika hosted MCP SSE URL:
   ```
   https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/sse
   ```
2. Click **Install** to complete the setup
3. Restart VS Code if prompted

</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify MCP Integration">
1. Open **Copilot Chat** in VS Code
2. Ask: "What are the top liquidity pools on Ethereum?"
3. You should see DexPaprika data being retrieved and displayed
4. Ask about specific networks, tokens, or pools to test further

</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If the button is not visible, copy this URL into the prompt when VS Code asks for the server address: `https://mcp.dexpaprika.com/sse`.
