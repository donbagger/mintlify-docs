openapi: get /pools
---

<Warning>
  **This endpoint has been deprecated and will return a `410 Gone` error.**
  
  Please use [`/networks/{network}/pools`](/api-reference/pools/get-top-x-pools-on-a-network) instead to get top pools for each specific blockchain network.
  
  ### Migration Examples:
  
  Instead of:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET "https://api.dexpaprika.com/pools"
  ```
  
  Use network-specific endpoints:
  ```bash
  # Get top pools on Ethereum
  curl -X GET "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/ethereum/pools"
  
  # Get top pools on Solana  
  curl -X GET "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/solana/pools"
  
  # Get top pools on Fantom
  curl -X GET "https://api.dexpaprika.com/networks/fantom/pools"
  ```
  
  This change provides better performance and more relevant, network-specific results.
